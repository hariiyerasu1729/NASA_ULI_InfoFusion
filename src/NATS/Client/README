National Airspace Trajectory-Prediction System(NATS)

Client Program Module

This program module allows the users to access the NATS functions implemented on the server through the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) technology. Users can create customized programs by calling server-side RMI functions to load flight plan, weather, Center/Sector definition databases, propagate aircraft trajectories in the National Airspace Ssystem (NAS,output trajectory data and create plots for visualization and analysis.  Please refer to dist/javadoc_client/com/osi/nats/api/package-frame.html for additional information on available functions (API).

2. RAM capacity at least 1GB


Software Requirements
=====================
1. Linux 64bit Operating System
   NATS software has been tested on:

   # CentOS 6.9 with gcc 4.4
   # CentOS 7 with gcc 4.8
2. Java 1.7 and later
3. Jpype(For Python codes)
   Tested on v0.6.0
   
   To install Jpype 0.6.0
   Go to https://github.com/originell/jpype
   Download jpype-0.6.0.tar.gz
   Unzip it, enter the directory and execute commands.
       sudo python setup.py install
4. MATLAB(if applicable)
   Tested on MATLAB R2014b, R2015b
5. Python 2.7


NATS client config file
=======================
The config file is located at data/nats.config
Two required parameters:
1. Hostname/IP address of the target NATS server to connect to.
2. Port number to connect to(default: 2017)


Running sample programs
===========================
NATS interface functions are written in Java and provided through the server-client mechanism to the user for their software development.  Python and MATLAB interfaces are provided for interactive or batch computations by non-Java users.  Certain bridge plugins/wrapers are required to enable this functionality.
===========================
1. Usage in Java
   1.1 Modify the script runSample_Java
       Edit NATS_CLIENT_HOME with correct path on your machine.
       Edit correct JDK/JRE path on your machine.(Please use Java 1.7 and later.)
   1.2 Execute ./runSample_Java
       (It is suggested to call run script from the current directory path.)

2. Usage with Python Jpype
   (Please install Jpype plugin ready first.)
   2.1 Set environment variable JAVA_HOME
   2.2 Edit Sample_Python_Jpype.py and specify the correct path of nats-client.jar and nats-shared.jar
   2.3 Execute
           python Sample_Python_Jpype.py

Note: If you are running in a Python IDE, please make sure that you set JAVA_HOME and set the working directory to NATS_Client in the runtime configuration.

3. Usage with MATLAB
   3.1 Edit Sample_Matlab.m and specify the correct path of nats-client.jar and nats-shared.jar
   3.2 Run Sample_Matlab.m.


Q & A
=====
1. The client program throws out error about not finding the nats.config file.
   Ans. Client program will look for data/nats.config file in runtime.  Please make sure you execute your program under NATS_Client directory.  If you have to execute the client program in different directory, please set OS environment variable NATS_CLIENT_HOME to the path of NATS_Client folder.
        Example. In Linux command-line terminal, type
            export NATS_CLIENT_HOME=/your_path/NATS_Client
