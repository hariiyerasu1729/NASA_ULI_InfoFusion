National Airspace Trajectory-Prediction System(NATS)

Server Program Module

This program module is responsible for all the computations related to aircraft trajectory propagation and data manipulation.  This module provides several functional interfaces in order to serve Java RMI communication in the server-client design architecture.  The client side program module contains corresponding functional interfaces corresponding to those on the server module.

Starting the NATS server
=========================
This is the first step in using the NATS software. The following steps are required:

1. Modify the run script
   Edit NATS_SERVER_HOME with correct path on your machine.
   Edit correct JDK/JRE path on your machine.(Please use Java 1.7 or later.)
2. Execute the run script in command-line terminal.  Example: ./run
   (It is suggested that you call the run script from the current directory path.)


Stopping the NATS server
======================
This is generally the last step while using the NATS software. The NATS software can be stopped by pressing [Ctrl]-C in the command-line terminal.
